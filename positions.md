<a id="postdocs"></a>
The majority of our work in the lab is computational, but many of the ongoing projects provide ample opportunity to interact with experimental groups.  We are generally looking for candidates with a background or strong interest in computational biology, systems biology, biochemistry, data science, theoretical physics, or computer science. Applicants with knowledge of R and/or python and with experience in high-performance computing environments are preferred.


**Postdocs.**
Job ads for specific postdoc positions are listed below.

August 6, 2020: The Wilke and [Barrick](https://barricklab.org) labs have a new NIH-funded position for a postdoctoral researcher on a project that will design and test mechanistic models of bacteriophage infection, replication, and evolution for applications in phage therapy and the design of attenuated vaccines. The ideal applicant will be a recent PhD with some combination of skills and interests in computational biology, phage biology, genome engineering, evolution, and synthetic biology.

Contact wilke@austin.utexas.edu and jbarrick@cm.utexas.edu for more information. Send a cover letter, CV, and contact information for three references to apply.

**Graduate students.**
Prospective graduate students should inquire with Claus Wilke, but will have to apply through the regular process at UT Austin, either with the [Ecology, Evolution, & Behavior Graduate Program](http://www.biosci.utexas.edu/graduate/eeb/) or with the [Cell and Molecular Biology Graduate Program](https://icmb.utexas.edu/cmb/).

**Undergraduates.**
Undergraduates usually work for course credit or volunteer. Please contact Claus Wilke and inquire about current opportunities.
