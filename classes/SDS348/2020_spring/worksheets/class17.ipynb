    "Python is an object-oriented programming language. In computer science, the term \"object\" describes the combination of data and methods that can manipulate the data. It is often convenient to keep the methods that operate on a given type of data together with the data itself, and therefore object-oriented programming is widely used and is pervasive throughout Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, most built-in data types in Python are objects. For example, we have previously worked with lists. Lists are objects. They contain data (the elements of the list) and methods that can manipulate the data (for example, the function `append()`):"
