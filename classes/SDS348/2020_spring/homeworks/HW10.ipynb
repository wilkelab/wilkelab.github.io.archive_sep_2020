    "**Problem 1 (5 pts)**: Often in bioinformatics, we need to format unique gene and/or protein identifiers. For instance, FASTA files downloaded from the UniProt database will have sequence identifiers that look like `>sp|Q8WZ42|TITIN_HUMAN`. For cross-referencing purposes (i.e., the way this ID is stored in other databases), we just need the `Q8WZ42` part. Write code that extracts this group between the `|` characters. Use this code to extract the UniProt IDs from both strings given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** Remember, the `|` symbol is normally used to say \"this or this\" or `this|this`. To match `|` in a string, as opposed to using it as a Boolean operator, you will need to escape the character with a backslash like so: `\\|`."
