    "In bioinformatics, we are often interested in determining whether or not two DNA or amino acid sequences are similar. One simple measure of similarity is called pairwise sequence identity. To calculate pairwise sequence identity, we take two sequences, count the number of positions in which both sequences share the same nucleotide or amino acid, and then divide by the total number of positions. For example, say we have these two DNA sequences: "

Use `sequence1` and `sequence2` to write a CSV file. Your code should generate a number for a position and check each position for a match.
