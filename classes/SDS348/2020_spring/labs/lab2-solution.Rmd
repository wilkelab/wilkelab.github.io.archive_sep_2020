## Lab Worksheet 2

We will be working with the `msleep` data set that is provided with ggplot2. The data set contains information about the sleep habits of 83 mammals. Enter `?msleep` on the R console to learn more about the dataset.

```{r }

head(msleep)

```

**Problem 1:** Make the following plots: (i) a plot of total time awake vs. body weight, colored by `vore` (carnivore, herbivore, etc.); (ii) a plot of body weight vs. brain weight, colored by "vore". When you plot body weight and/or brain weight, consider whether a linear scale or a logarithmic scale seems more appropriate, and explain your reasoning in 1-2 sentences. **HINT:** Use the functions `scale_x_log10()` and `scale_y_log10()` to change the scales.

```{r}

ggplot(msleep, aes(x = bodywt, y = awake, color = vore)) +
  geom_point() + 
  scale_x_log10(labels = comma)
  

ggplot(msleep, aes(x = brainwt, y = bodywt, color = vore)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10()

```

Log scales are more appropriate for both body weight and brain weight because there are a few species that have much larger values than most other species. If we were to use a linear scale, these outlying species would require axis ranges that are too wide to resolve any details for the majority of the species.

**Problem 2:** Plot `sleep_total` verses `bodywt` for **ONLY** carnivores, herbivores, and omnivores. Facet this plot by `vore`, and then fit a curve to each facet using `geom_smooth`. In 1-2 sentences, make one observation about total time asleep and body weight.

```{r }

msleep2 <- msleep %>%
  filter(vore == "omni" | vore == "carni" | vore == "herbi")

ggplot(msleep2, aes(x = bodywt, y = sleep_total, color = vore)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~vore) +
  scale_x_log10(label = comma) +
  xlab("Body weight (kg)") +
  ylab("Total sleep (hours)")

```


**Problem 3 (if time):** Explain the difference between `geom_line()` and `geom_path()`. Make up a simple data set (5-10 data points), plot it twice, once using `geom_line()` and once using `geom_path()`, and explain why each plot looks the way it does.

```{r}

d <- data.frame(x = c(1, 2, 1.5, 1), y = c(1, 1, 2, 1))
ggplot(d, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_line()
ggplot(d, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_path()

```

`geom_line()` connects data points in the order from smallest to largest x value. `geom_path()`, by contrast, connects data points in the order in which they appear in the data frame. The following data set produces an open triangle with `geom_line()` and a closed triangle with `geom_path()`.
