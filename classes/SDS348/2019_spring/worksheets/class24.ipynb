    "To read a file from the internet (i.e., from a URL), we can use the `urlopen()` function that is available in the package `urllib.request`. One subtle difficulty with this function is that it returns encoded strings (also called \"byte objects\") rather than raw strings. For example, the following code downloads the poem \"The Road Not Taken\" from the class website and prints it out. You can see how the output is encapsulated in quotes with a 'b' in front (for \"byte object\"), and also that the newline character is explicitly written out as '\\n'."
