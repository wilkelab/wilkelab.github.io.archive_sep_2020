    "**Problem 1 (5 points):** In bioinformatics, k-mers refer to all the possible subsequences (of length k) from a read obtained through DNA sequencing. For example, if the DNA sequencing read is \"ATCATCATG\", then the 3-mers in that read include \"ATC\" (which occurs twice), \"TCA\" (which occurs twice), \"CAT\" (occurs twice), and \"ATG\" (occurs once). You can read more about k-mers on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-mer).\n",
