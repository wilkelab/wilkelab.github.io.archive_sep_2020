To analyze the name of the product,  we will use the following regular expression: `r\"ase($|\\s)\"`. Remember that the vertical line `|` indicates logical or. So this regular expression searches for two alternative patterns. The first pattern, `r\"ase$\"` looks for strings that end in `ase`. The second pattern, `r\"ase\\s\"` looks for strings that contain a word ending in `ase`. (Word ends are indicated by subsequent whitespace, which is matched by `\\s`.)\n",
