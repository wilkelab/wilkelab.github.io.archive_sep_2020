This can become cumbersome, and in particular we may forget to close some of the files that we opened. Not closing files can cause all sorts of trouble. For example, other applications may not be able to interact with a file until your program has properly closed it. Or, if you write a loop that opens many files but never closes them, you may crash your computer. Thus, since closing files is so critical, wouldn't it be nice if Python did this for us automatically? It will do so, if we're using the `with` statement.\n",
